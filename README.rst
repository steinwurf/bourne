Usage

Usage examples are located in the examples folder.

Build
=====

Fetch the sources:

::

   git clone https://github.com/steinwurf/bourne
   cd bourne

We use the ``waf`` build system to build the bourne static library. We
have some additional waf tools which can be found at `waf
<https://github.com/steinwurf/waf>`_.

To configure and build bourne, run the following commands:

::

   python waf configure
   python waf build
   python waf install --destdir=/tmp

The final ``install`` step will create a folder containing all the
nessecary files needed to use the library (e.g. static library,
headers etc.). You can change the output folder by passing a different
path to ``--destdir``:

The code for this library have been inspired by the
`SimpleJSON <https://github.com/nbsdx/SimpleJSON/tree/f909b2433ada7e5ccaf4753ac74d82703a50547f>`_
library.
